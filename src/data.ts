  about: "I'm a developer who genuinely enjoys bringing ideas to life on the web. I don't just write code—I like to solve real problems and create experiences that feel effortless for the user. Whether I'm snapping together clean interfaces with React or wiring up sturdy backends with Spring Boot and MongoDB, I love the whole process. I'm always messing around with new tech, asking questions, and trying to build things that people actually want to use.",
